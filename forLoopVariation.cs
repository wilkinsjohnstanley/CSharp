/*
Although the three sections of the for loop 
are most commonly used for initializing a variable, 
testing it, and incrementing it, 
you can also perform other tasks:

    You can initialize more than one variable 
    by placing commas between separate initializations 
    in the first section of the for statement, 
    as in the following:
*/
for(g = 0; h = 1; g < 6; ++g)

//You can declare a new variable within the for statement
for(int k = 0; k <5; ++k)

//You can perform more than onoe test in the middle section 
  for(g=0;g<3 && h >1; ++g)

//You can decrement
    for(g=5; g>=1; --g)
// you can increment twice
for(g=0;g<5; ++g; ++h)
